I created this repo to apply for a job where I was accepted

It does not have the best practices for angular but I tried to apply some SOLID principles as Single Responsability principle and tried the most to keep my code clean for better understanding by the recruiter in the less time I could (I think that took 1 day).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
